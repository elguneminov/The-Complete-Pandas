<p><strong>Welcome to the Section Reshaping and Pivoting DataFrames</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In this Section, you will learn how to optimize your data for data presentation. </p><p>The optimal shape for data presentation purposes can differ from the most functional shape. Therefore, the paradigm "observations in rows and features in columns" will be relaxed in this Section.Â  </p><p><br></p><p>In addition, you will learn how to pivot, aggregate and group data with the methods </p><ul><li><p>pivot()</p></li><li><p>pivot_table() </p></li><li><p>pd.crosstab()</p></li></ul><p>Keep in mind: All you can do with these three methods can also be done with a combination of groupby() and unstack(), and even more. </p><p>My recommendation: Master groupby() and know the few cases, where pivot() or pd.crosstab() might be a convenient alternative! </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Have Fun!</strong></p>
